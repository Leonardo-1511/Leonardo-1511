## About me
Hey, I'm Leonardo!

I would like to say that I am a self-taught developer, but I find that I still have much to learn before I could call myself with such title.
So instead I refer to myself as a continuously learning enthusiast in the world of software development.

## What I'm working on
Currently I'm trying to get an apprenticeship in the Country that I live, meanwhile though you may want to see my public repositories. There's little to none Public, but that just because I found the others to not be good enough to display.

## Contact
You can contact me through the given Links at any time, my E-Mail is also always reachable.

It doesn't matter what exactly it is, if you want to just talk or have questions, thats fine too!
